# Case Study: ImmobilienScout24

## Background

Finding a flat in Berlin is a big challenge! In a huge city with so many districts, prices and options you can get lost during search. If you are new to the city, how can you find a flat without ending up in Spandau or paying 1000 euros for a shared flat?

## Challenge

The biggest platform for flats in Berlin ist Immo Scout24. But on their website there was no possibility to analyse the market and to get a good overview / map on where a cheap flat is listed.

## Development

Over the course of 50 days the all listings in Berlin were scraped with a python script and saved to a database once a day. In the end 10.000 listings were saved. The data was analysed with the Tableau Desktop Tool. Different visualizations were created and a Dashboard with an interactive map was created.
Result

Here are the key findings after analysing the data:

## Key Findings

- Searching is most effective on weekdays, not weekends.
- The Berlin city owned housing associations (Wohnungsbaugesellschaften) and Deutsche Wohnen put many low-priced listings online.
- Apply as fast as possible, don't wait, as offers are often only online for one day.
- Price dispersion is very high in popular districts. You should compare several listings there.
